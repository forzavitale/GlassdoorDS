Data Scientist,2019-01-19,2019-02-22,Insurance,Argo Group US,"['15-1111.00', 'Computer and Information Research Scientists']","Data Scientist Before the dawn of everything internet, insurance was intimate and personal. You walked down the street to chat with your broker and the risk to your business, your livelihood, was covered with a handshake. Today is different. The average insurance policy for a mom-and-pop store trades through a dozen different hands and traverses a maze of systems and processes. Few are accountable and fewer know the whole story. This is just a taste of the type of big problem we want you to solve. We seek a data scientist to help drive a new digital product innovation team on a mission to bring a new type of interaction to a market once exclusively driven by in-person relationships. As one of the founding members of a small, multi-disciplinary team of technologists, designers and product managers, you’ll have the freedom to make key product decisions without much oversight, and the tools and resources to build and ship ideas quickly. You’ll be a part of a startup-like environment in a company with thousands of existing customers. Who you are You’re working at a startup with a lifespan near its finish. You’re the talented member of a team at a popular technology company looking for the opportunity to have more control and leadership. You’re the workhorse at an agency, tired of coding products for promotions instead of real users. Ever thought of creating your own product? Some signs you might be ready: You are excited to craft and deploy models that transform one of the most entrenched industries in the world. You want to use your statistical, scientific and engineering training to work with data structures where off-the-shelf programs just won’t do it. You paint with plots and your models don’t keep secrets. NLP isn’t a foreign acronym and you’ve gone from strings to whiskers. You sail smooth in R and always have numPy, sciPy and scikit-learn on deck. K-means more than a curt text and Logit and Probit are not Hobbit characters. Your best friend is a banker and you want your neighbor to be an engineer. You’ve taken a Turing test and weren’t sure about the results. You have experience with relational databases such as PostgreSQL, Oracle or SQL Server, and maybe even Hadoop, Hive, Spark or Redshift. What you'll own The foundation for advanced analytics at a global company. The roadmap of projects you’ll work on that tie directly to business goals and objectives. Manage the entire lifecycle of data projects from strategic planning to tactical activities (data collection, cleanup, analysis, model implementation). Sourcing new data for a firm that rarely scrapes, pulls or pushes. Facilitate communication throughout the development process between executive stakeholders, your customers (internal business unit leaders) and technical teams that are implementing/automating your work . Coordinate and build strong working relations with various internal stakeholder groups, including IT, engineering and legal. Skill set Develop custom data models and algorithms to apply to data sets. Coordinate with different functional teams to implement models and monitor outcomes. Develop processes and tools to monitor and analyze model performance and data accuracy. Develop company A/B testing framework and test model quality.

When is the best time to implement these actions?” This functional area examines the drivers of clinical outcomes; analyzes opportunities for managing risk-based populations; evaluates programs and interventions that aim to improve patient outcomes. Quality analytics – “How is quality of care measured and how is it related to patient outcomes? Where are opportunities to improve the quality of care to our patients and members?” Analysts in this functional area serve as subject matter experts on healthcare quality measurement and risk adjustment; use predictive modeling to identify patient populations in need of clinical interventions; identify opportunities for improvement in clinical processes that can lead to improved quality of care.   Operational analytics – “How can we optimize our business operations in order to be more efficient? How do we deliver our services in order to improve the coordination of care for our patients and members?” This functional area focuses on efficiency and optimization of business practices in order to improve patient care; uses techniques including time series forecasting and geospatial analysis to address business problems such as staffing and scheduling; analyzes opportunities for business growth within the organization and predicts and forecasts expenses. Policy analytics – “What is the impact of health care policy on our patient population? On our most vulnerable patients and members? How will changes in reimbursement policy affect the way we deliver patient care? What partnerships can we develop in order to ensure that our patients and members continue receiving optimal care?” Analysts in this functional area serve as subject matter experts on healthcare policy; analyze areas for meaningful value investments that focus on improving health outcomes while saving money; use predictive modeling to identify high cost and high need patient populations who may be impacted most by changes in health policy.

The scammers frequently misappropriate and use a company's logo and photos of its executives to give the appearance of legitimacy. The scam preys upon those seeking employment, and uses false fraudulent offers of employment with employers, such as CBS, to steal from the victims. CBS believes that one of the best ways to put a stop to this scam is to make you aware of it. No applicant for employment with CBS is ever required to pay any money as part of the job application or hiring process, and CBS's job recruitment process involves in person and/or telephonic interviews in most cases. In addition, CBS's job recruiting staff sends email communications to job applicants from @******* email accounts only. Any email that states to be from CBS but does not have a @******* address should be assumed to be fraudulent. Recognizing Recruiting Fraud The following are warning signs of recruiting fraud: You are required to provide your credit card, bank account number(s) or other personal financial information as part of the job application process. The open position does not appear on the company's website listing of job positions. The contact email address contains a domain other than @*******, such as @********, @*********, or another personal email account. The position required an initial monetary investment, such as a payment by wire transfer. The posting includes spelling and grammatical errors. You are offered a payment or reward in exchange for allowing the use of your bank account (e.g., for depositing checks or transferring money related to employment). You are asked to provide a photo of yourself. The job posting does not mention required qualifications and job responsibilities, but instead focuses on the amount of money to be made. The job posting reflects initial pay that is high compared to the average compensation for the position type. The 'employer' contacts you by phone, but there is no way to call them back or the number is not active or goes only to a voice message box. What You Can Do If you believe you have been the victim of job recruiting fraud, you can: File an incident report at ************************* File a complaint with the FBI at: *************** Call the FTC at: 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-************) Contact the local police to report the fraud. Contact your bank or credit card company to close the account and dispute the charges.
