In the last eight years, weve grown to over 60 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada, opened our first optical lab in upstate New York, and launched two of our own iOS apps. And for three years running, Fast Company has named us one of the worlds most innovative companies. We also hold ourselves to the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility. This means lots of different things, like operating carbon-neutrally and distributing a pair of glasses to someone in need for every pair we sell.

Total assets under management at year end 2016, with affiliates, totaled $538 billion. As of year-end 2016, New York Life's surplus was $23.336 billion**. New York Life holds the highest possible financial strength ratings currently awarded to any life insurer from all four of the major ratings agencies: A.M. Best, A++; Fitch AAA; Moody's Aaa; Standard & Poor's AA+. (Source: Individual Third Party Ratings Report as of 8/17/16). Financial strength, integrity and humanity-the values upon which New York Life was founded-have guided the company's decisions and actions for over 170 years.

Our team works hand-in-hand with strategy consulting teams, adding expertise where a good solution requires grappling with enormous and/or non-standard data sources, applying highly specialized data science techniques, and/or developing reusable codebases and templates to accelerate the rate of progress. Our work is fast paced and expansive. We build models, coalesce data sources, interpret results, and build services and occasionally products that enhance our clients’ ability to derive value from data and that upgrade their decision-making capabilities. Our solutions feature the latest in data science tools, machine learning / A.I. algorithms, software engineering disciplines, and analytical techniques to make an extraordinary impact on clients and societies. We operate at the intersection of “cool tech” and real world problems faced by some of the world's leading companies. We hire smart, driven people and equip them with the tools and support that they need to get their jobs done. Overall Purpose of the Role The Data Science Consultant (DSC) works directly with clients and project teams, providing essential insight and leverage on problems where data science expertise is essential. S/he works to understand, describe and manage the lifecycle of analytics on a project from start to finish. While deeply involved with the technical solution, a DSC works equally on the execution, communication and delivery of a client project, often acting as the team’s de facto tech lead. As DSCs progress professionally, they tend towards greater depth in both data scientific principles and skills as well as domain-specific expertise, ‘majoring’ in a subset of industries and becoming increasingly recognized as pivotal individuals in pushing forward the frontier of our capabilities to crack increasingly broad problems – and, in doing so, to shape the evolution of the firm and the industries it serves. DSCs thus develop the expertise to know which quantitative problems are the most valuable in a certain industry, to understand which features and model structures are best suited to solving them, and to know how to tune such solutions in light of industry specific requirements and ecosystems. Ultimately, DSCs thus act as a crucial engine of progress, designing and maintaining assets and problem solving platforms.

New York Life holds the highest possible financial strength ratings currently awarded to any life insurer from all four of the major ratings agencies: A.M. Best, A++; Fitch AAA; Moody’s Aaa; Standard & Poor’s AA+. (Source: Individual Third Party Ratings Report as of 8/17/16). Financial strength, integrity and humanity—the values upon which New York Life was founded—have guided the company’s decisions and actions for over 170 years.

This is just one of several projects with large business value. Geographic analytics on agents and customers, application fraud detection, agent success prediction and client prospecting analytics (off-line and on-line) are other exciting examples of enormous incremental value from analytics.

Founded in 1845, New York Life is headquartered in New York City, maintains offices in all fifty states, and owns Seguros Monterrey New York Life in Mexico. New York Life is one of the most financially strong and highly capitalized insurers in the business. The company reported 2016 operating earnings of $1.954 billion. Total assets under management at year end 2016, with affiliates, totaled $538 billion. As of year-end 2016, New York Life’s surplus was $23.336 billion**. New York Life holds the highest possible financial strength ratings currently awarded to any life insurer from all four of the major ratings agencies: A.M. Best, A++; Fitch AAA; Moody’s Aaa; Standard & Poor’s AA+. (Source: Individual Third Party Ratings Report as of 8/17/16). Financial strength, integrity and humanity—the values upon which New York Life was founded—have guided the company’s decisions and actions for over 170 years. New York Life , the largest writer of retail life insurance in the U.S. and a top player in annuities, long-term care and mutual funds, is seeking a Data Engineer in its Center for Data Science and Analytics.

We also have a multitude of external data from a great variety of sources.  New York Life is likely the most data-rich company in the life insurance industry.

This is just one of several projects with large business value. Geographic analytics on agents and customers, application fraud detection, agent success prediction and client prospecting analytics (off-line and on-line) are other exciting examples of enormous incremental value from analytics.

At Custora, we’re helping turn this model on its head, using mountains of data to help our customers direct the right campaigns to the right users rather than blasting the same message to the largest audience possible. We're moving at a rapid pace, taking on bigger customers every day and increasing the amount of data we collect by several orders of magnitude. As we leap into the next phase of our growth, we need developers who are motivated to solve interesting problems, experiment with new technology and help us change the way e-commerce marketing works in ways that will benefit both companies and consumers. We   have   hard   problems   to   solve. We're already analyzing data for well over 500,000,000 end customers, and this number is growing fast. We're pulling data from numerous sources, computing sophisticated statistics on the fly and building a marketing experimentation platform that's usable by the entire marketing team. You'll   have lots   of   responsibility. We're a small team, and each of us leads the projects we are most passionate about. You'll be able to own large parts of the software. Specifically, we’re looking for someone who can make strong contributions to our infrastructure.

Try   new   things. Experimentation is one of our core values at Custora and we need engineers who will apply new approaches to solving our problems. As our data grows and we move from a batch processing model to real-time analytics, we are ready and able to try new solutions. Have   fun   while   you’re   doing   it. We believe solving hard problems is easiest in a fun, relaxed, and collaborative environment. Our team enjoys a good joke as much as fixing a tough bug. We want to find engineers who are eager to continue this balance — creating a place where people look forward to going to work. The Stack: While we make use of a wide variety of tools, our primary web stack is ES6/React and Ruby on Rails deployed on AWS. We make extensive use of R for statistical analysis, and our primary data stores are Hive, MySQL, and Redis.
