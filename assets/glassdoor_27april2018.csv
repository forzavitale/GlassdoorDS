Since Warby Parker is vertically integrated, with a strong retail and e-commerce business, there are a lot of places for statistics and machine learning to improve how we operate. Last year alone we simulated billions of potential supply chain networks, designed a study to test a vision exam that you can take on your mobile phone, and developed an emoji-powered Halloween costume recommender. We work closely with every part of the company to help them do their jobs with more clarity and context. Want to help us advance the technology that got Warby Parker featured in  Forbes ,  Vogue ,  The New York Times , and  Inc. , and named Most Innovative by  Fast Company ? Read on for more about the job. What youll do: As a Data Scientist youll lead one to three projects at a time, working closely with our Product Manager and other Data Scientists to bring your project to fruition. Youll spend time talking to people in other parts of the business, using your knowledge of math and statistics to model their challenges and make their problems amenable to being aided by data. Youll implement your models as tested, maintainable software, receiving feedback from others in the process, and working with our Engineering team when needed to make your software more stable and automated. In collaboration with our Product Manager, youll work to help your stakeholders learn from and act on what you discover. Who you are: This job is a blend of statistical modeling and software development, so you have 3+ years of experience doing both in a business or non-profit setting. You have a Masters (or equivalent work experience) in statistics, a quantitative social science, epidemiology, or similar. You have experience with the tools of modern software engineering, like working at the command line, writing reusable code, using version control, writing tests, and so on. You have a good numerical sense and are able to think probabilistically. Communication and working with others is key to success on our team. You are empathetic and capable of talking with people from a wide variety of backgrounds. You can write clear expository prose about complex topics. You are be curious about how things work, and are comfortable teaching yourself new concepts and skills from books and from talking to others.

By circumventing traditional channels and designing our frames in house, were able to offer insanely high-quality eyewear at decidedly non-insane prices (i.e., from $95 with prescription lensesa fraction of the going price!). In the last eight years, weve grown to over 60 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada, opened our first optical lab in upstate New York, and launched two of our own iOS apps. And for three years running, Fast Company has named us one of the worlds most innovative companies. We also hold ourselves to the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility. This means lots of different things, like operating carbon-neutrally and distributing a pair of glasses to someone in need for every pair we sell. (Were big believers that businesses can scale and be profitable while doing good in the world.) Of course, all work and no play makes an extremely dull office, and no one likes an extremely dull office. (We sure dont.) As an employee at Warby Parker, you can look forward to company outings, guest speakers, volunteering opportunities, and other brain- (and/or taste-bud-) stimulating activities. It also doesnt hurt that our team is just great company.

Founded in 1845, New York Life is headquartered in New York City, maintains offices in all fifty states, and owns Seguros Monterrey New York Life in Mexico. New York Life is one of the most financially strong and highly capitalized insurers in the business. The company reported 2016 operating earnings of $1.954 billion. Total assets under management at year end 2016, with affiliates, totaled $538 billion. As of year-end 2016, New York Life‚Äôs surplus was $23.336 billion**. New York Life holds the highest possible financial strength ratings currently awarded to any life insurer from all four of the major ratings agencies: A.M. Best, A++; Fitch AAA; Moody‚Äôs Aaa; Standard & Poor‚Äôs AA+. (Source: Individual Third Party Ratings Report as of 8/17/16). Financial strength, integrity and humanity‚Äîthe values upon which New York Life was founded‚Äîhave guided the company‚Äôs decisions and actions for over 170 years. Lead Data Scientist New York Life , the largest writer of retail life insurance in the U.S. and a top player in annuities, long-term care and mutual funds, is seeking a Lead Data Scientist in its Center for Data Science and Analytics. The company has over 150 years of history and while usable data does not quite go back this far, we have a wealth of internal information on consumers, policies and their performance, as well as applicants, prospects and our 10,000 agents. We also have a multitude of external data from a great variety of sources. New York Life is likely the most data-rich company in the life insurance industry. Analytical challenges range from mortality risk (with a number of both medical and non-medical components) to agent recruiting decisions, consumer analytics (segmentation, response, conversion, retention, up-sell), fraud detection and digital advertising placement. The  Center for Data Science and Analytics  is the innovative corporate Analytics group within New York Life. We are a rapidly growing entrepreneurial department which aims to design, create and offer innovative data-driven solutions for many parts of the enterprise. We are aided by New York Life‚Äôs existing business with a large market share in individual life insurance. We have the freedom to explore external data sources and new statistical techniques, and are excited about delivering a whole new generation of Analytical solutions. In fact, we are designing and will build one of the first multivariate model-based continuous risk differentiations in the industry. This model will incorporate current underwriting best practices (including medical rules) as features and add other data sources, patterns/ideas and variables to essentially create a rating plan to support the next generation underwriting process at New York Life. This is just one of several projects with large business value. Geographic analytics on agents and customers, application fraud detection, agent success prediction and client prospecting analytics (off-line and on-line) are other exciting examples of enormous incremental value from analytics. Our products will be implemented into real-time core business processes and decisions that drive the company (e.g. underwriting, pricing, agent recruiting, prospecting, new product development). We work with data ranging from demographics, credit and geo data to detailed medical data (medical test results, diagnosis, prescriptions) and social media information. We have a modern computing environment with a solid suite of data science/modeling tools and packages, and a large (but manageable) group of well-trained professionals at various levels to support you. Life insurance is on the verge of huge change. This is a chance to be part of, actually to drive, the transformation of an industry. Is this not why we became data scientists?

Best, A++; Fitch AAA; Moody‚Äôs Aaa; Standard & Poor‚Äôs AA+. (Source: Individual Third Party Ratings Report as of 8/17/16). Financial strength, integrity and humanity‚Äîthe values upon which New York Life was founded‚Äîhave guided the company‚Äôs decisions and actions for over 170 years.
